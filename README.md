<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## 💻 Getting Started <a name="getting-started"></a>

### Prerequisites

In order to run this project you need to have a browser and of course a code editor



### Setup

Clone this repository to your desired folder, you can also set up HTML, CSS and JavaScript linters, for this you will need node installed. you can follow the steps [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/html-css) and [here](https://github.com/microverseinc/linters-config/tree/master/javascript) to setup the linters


### Install

Once you cloned this project you are done !


### Usage

To run the project follow these steps :
1. Install `Node.js` and `npm` on your computer (If you don't have them yet).
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
3. Run the command ```$npm start ``` in your terminal.
4. Your default browser should open automatically and display your React app
5. Because it's a mobile application,
you will need to <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/browser-developer-tools/" target="_blank"> access your browser's developer </a> mode and reduce the screen size to that of a mobile phone.
6. This project uses data provided by: financial modelling prep, as this project uses a free version of their API, which contains several restrictions, including:
- Limiting requests to 250 per day
- Use of data on US companies only.
- No-authorization to retrieve companies by region.
Therefore, You will find a sample of 42 US companies we used for our projects.
But to limit the number of requests sent to the API, a function was finally created to retrieve 10 companies at random from the 42 but you can change this configuration in the `FilterCompanyProfiles.js` component on line 23.

##### Note : 
We provide profile keys here so that you can use them if you reach the number of requests allowed. Inside the `util` folder change the value of `key` variable in the `fetchAPI.js` file :
- ```$

  ```

### Run tests

If you follow the tutorial above to setup linters then you can run these tests

```$
